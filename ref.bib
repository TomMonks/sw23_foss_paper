Bespoke academic projects provide little scope for repeatable practical application and efforts to develop generic reusable solutions have neither clearly identified the end users nor fully appreciated their multifaceted requirements. Influenced by a review of existing findings and recommendations in addition to a customised survey of prospective end users, a set of practical design principles were elicited in guiding development of a new open-source and versatile tool. Capturing variability in arrivals and length of stay as well as the stochastic nature of dynamic delays in patient discharge and transfer, the PathSimR tool can be used to model various user-defined configurations of outpatient and inpatient pathways. In addition to reporting on early use and engagement initiatives to promote the tool, this study also offers a blueprint for how simulation models can be developed and deployed within the healthcare setting.},

Three discrete event simulation models are provided to evaluate the resource requirements during the peak of the pandemic. First, we estimate the number of beds needed in the emergency department (ED). In the second model, we estimate the number of ambulances required to maintain prepandemic response times for emergency patients. The third model is a coupling of the two former models, and it is used to study the effects of ED boarding time for COVID-19 patients. The resource needs are analysed under different COVID-19 testing policies. A strict testing policy increases the bed requirements in the ED, while it has the opposite effect for ambulances. Two distinct mechanisms causing boarding time are found. The effects from boarding time are most prominent during night and weekends.},

Firstly, that generic models sacrifice the relative simplicity of a bespoke simulation model for flexibility. Secondly, that generic models are published in conceptual form only. If researchers cannot access computer implementation of models, then there is little incentive or benefit to recode one over coding a simpler bespoke simulation model. We introduce an incremental approach to generic modelling in discrete-event simulation. We develop an archetype setting-specific generic model of a hospital ward. The archetype model is first developed and applied in a rehabilitation ward setting. Then a second team applies the model in a specialised intensive care setting. We report the successes, obstacles and redevelopment needed for reuse of the generic model along with how the results of these studies were used to inform healthcare delivery.},

	abstract = {This study presents two simulation modelling tools to support the organisation of networks of dialysis services during the COVID-19 pandemic. These tools were developed to support renal services in the South of England (the Wessex region caring for 650 dialysis patients), but are applicable elsewhere. A discrete-event simulation was used to model a worst case spread of COVID-19, to stress-test plans for dialysis provision throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. We investigated the ability of the system to manage the mix of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, the likely effects on patients, outpatient workloads across all units, and inpatient workload at the centralised COVID-positive inpatient unit. A second Monte-Carlo vehicle routing model estimated the feasibility of patient transport plans. If current outpatient capacity is maintained there is sufficient capacity in the South of England to keep COVID-19 negative/recovered and positive patients in separate sessions, but rapid reallocation of patients may be needed. Outpatient COVID-19 cases will spillover to a secondary site while other sites will experience a reduction in workload. The primary site chosen to manage infected patients will experience a significant increase in outpatients and inpatients. At the peak of infection, it is predicted there will be up to 140 COVID-19 positive patients with 40 to 90 of these as inpatients, likely breaching current inpatient capacity. Patient transport services will also come under considerable pressure. If patient transport operates on a policy of one positive patient at a time, and two-way transport is needed, a likely scenario estimates 80 ambulance drive time hours per day (not including fixed drop-off and ambulance cleaning times). Relaxing policies on individual patient transport to 2-4 patients per trip can save 40-60\% of drive time. In mixed urban/rural geographies steps may need to be taken to temporarily accommodate renal COVID-19 positive patients closer to treatment facilities.},

Given the vast scale of the health care modelling literature, a novel review methodology was adopted, similar in concept to the approach of stratified sampling. The results provide new insights into the level of activity across many areas of application, highlighting important relationships and pointing to key areas of omission and neglect in the literature.

We present here RESTful-CD++, the first distributed simulation middleware based on REST (Representational State Transfer) Web-services. RESTful-CD++ middleware enables heterogeneous independent-developed simulation components to interoperate with much flexibility and simplicity. REST has the potential to advance distributed simulation state-of-the-art towards plug-and-play or automatic/semi-automatic interoperability. This because of its lightweight approach hides internal software implementation by using universal uniform interface and describing connectivity semantics in form of messages, usually XML. In contrast, other approaches expose functionalities in heterogeneous RPCs that often reflect internal implementation and describe semantics in form of procedure parameters. Further, REST enables simulations to mashup with Web 2.0 applications, which makes simulation in link with any device attached to the Web dynamically at runtime. The CD++ tool is now the first simulation engine to use RESTful middleware to perform distributed simulation in large-scale.},

	abstract = {The web has a short history, but has grown at an exponential pace since its introduction six years ago. Web-based simulation represents the connection between the web and the field of simulation. Web based simulation is not an existing field but rather an idea which represents an interest on the part of simulationists to exploit web technology. To further this cause, I present some issues and concepts in web based simulation to serve as a back drop for a more formal discussion, and potentially the formation of a new simulation sub-area.},

	abstract = {We describe a mechanism for providing a discrete-event simulation facility on the Web. The mechanism calls for integrating the CORBA and Java technologies - simulation applications (models) written in Java access discrete-event simulation capability through a CORBA interface. The discrete-event simulation facility is specified in CORBA IDL which defines operations for object definition, inter-object communication, and event scheduling. The IDL interface definition may be implemented in Java by using different simulation algorithms, over different operating systems or hardware platforms. Simulation applications, developed as stand-alone Java applications or Java applets running within Web browsers, access the facility via the Internet inter-ORB protocol (IIOP) to obtain runtime support for model execution. The paper presents the discrete-event simulation facility IDL interface, describes its prototype implementation using Java and OrbixWeb, and illustrates its application via a producer-consumer example written in Java.},

	abstract = {Simulation is aimed very often to solve problems of great complexity requiring – beyond using the advanced simulation software tools – platforms that enable the implementation of such software systems. In recent years the concept of cloud computing has emerged and is being applied more and more widely for solving such problems. This paper, beyond delineating the main trends of the development of distributed simulation over a grid, especially over the Internet through Web-based applications, highlights the concepts of service-based simulation system approach. This concept gives the possibility of implementing Web- or cloud agents and other ASP system compliant simulation services based on simulation standards. As a sample application, Fuzzy Web Service is demonstrated as a part of CASSANDRA 4.0 (Cognizant Adaptive Simulation System for Applications in Numerous Different Relevant Areas) that is developed by the McLeod Institute of Simulation Sciences Hungarian Center.},
